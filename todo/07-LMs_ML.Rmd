# Linear Models and Maximum Likelihood (ML) {#lmML}
(`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y, %H:%M')`)

-- to-do --


<!-- - maximum likelihood estimation -->
<!-- - samples estimates -->
<!-- - very indirect inference for population parameters -->
<!-- - null-hypothesis significance tests: bootstap (only mention t-tests, F-tests, and all that, and how to read them) -->

<!-- - not sure if here, or the probability section is the right place to mention sampling distributions and do a little simulation with shows how much spread there should be between items in an acceptability experiment if all items were actually underlyingly equal  -->

<!-- - squeeze in repeated mentions of sample-population distinction -->
