<li><p>Any time that you get a new data set to look at, one of the first tasks that you have to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily understood fashion. This is what <strong><em>descriptive statistics</em></strong> (as opposed to <strong><em>inferential statistics</em></strong>) is all about. In fact, to many people the term “statistics” is synonymous with descriptive statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>Before going into any details, let’s take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive statistics. To do this, let’s load a dataset on sleep in mammals.</p></li>

<li>This output doesn’t make it easy to get a sense of what the data are actually saying. Just “looking at the data” isn’t a terribly effective way of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what’s going on, we need to calculate some descriptive statistics and draw some nice pictures.
<!--
to-do: Brief explanation of histograms
(Chapter \@ref(graphics). Since the descriptive statistics are the easier of the two topics, I'll start with those, but nevertheless I'll show you a histogram of the `afl.margins` data, since it should help you get a sense of what the data we're trying to describe actually look like. But for what it's worth, this histogram -- which is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:histogram1) -- was generated using the `hist()` function. We'll talk a lot more about how to draw histograms in Section \@ref(hist). For now, it's enough to look at the histogram and note that it provides a fairly interpretable representation of the `afl.margins` data.

<li>Let’s take a look at a <strong><em>histogram</em></strong> of these data: A <strong><em>histogram</em></strong> is a graphical representation of the frequencies of different values of ranges of values in the data.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Measures of central tendency</h2>
<p>Drawing pictures of the data, as I did in Figure <a href="descriptives.html#fig:histogram1">3.1</a> is an excellent way to convey the “gist” of what the data is trying to tell you, it’s often extremely useful to try to condense the data into a few simple “summary” statistics. In most situations, the first thing that you’ll want to calculate is a measure of <strong><em>central tendency</em></strong>. That is, you’d like to know something about the “average” or “middle” of your data lies. The two most commonly used measures are the mean, median and mode; occasionally people will also report a trimmed mean. I’ll explain each of these in turn, and then discuss when each of them is useful.</p>
<div id="mean" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> The mean</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong><em>mean</em></strong> of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned average: add all of the values up, and then divide by the total number of values. The first five animals’ typical amount of sleep is 12 + 17 + 14 + 15 + 4, so the mean of these observations is just:
<span class="math display">\[
\frac{12 + 17 + 14 + 15 + 4}{5} = \frac{62.4}{5} = 12.48
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Of course, this definition of the mean isn’t news to anyone: averages (i.e., means) are used so often in everyday life that this is pretty familiar stuff. However, since the concept of a mean is something that everyone already understands, I’ll use this as an excuse to start introducing some of the mathematical notation that statisticians use to describe this calculation, and talk about how the calculations would be done in R.</p></li>
<li><p>The first piece of notation to introduce is <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, which we’ll use to refer to the number of observations that we’re averaging (in this case <span class="math inline">\(N = 5\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we need to attach a label to the observations themselves. It’s traditional to use <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we’re actually talking about.</p></li>
<li><p>That is, we’ll use <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> to refer to the first observation, <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to <span class="math inline">\(X_N\)</span> for the last one. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly more abstract way, we use <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> to refer to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th observation. Just to make sure we’re clear on the notation, the following table lists the 5 observations in the <code>sleep_total_h</code> variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it, and the actual value that the observation corresponds to:</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- to-do: the sleep data isn't great, because it actually consists of averages itself; moreover they are bounded -->

<ul>
<li><p>Okay, now let’s try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula:
<span class="math display">\[
\bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N}
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This formula is entirely correct, but it’s terribly long, so we make use of the <strong><em>summation symbol</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle\sum\)</span> to shorten it.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, <span class="math inline">\(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5\)</span> or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this:
<span class="math display">\[
\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Taken literally, this could be read as “the sum, taken over all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> values from 1 to 5, of the value <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>”. But basically, what it means is “add up the first five observations”. In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this:
<span class="math display">\[
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i 
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>In all honesty, I can’t imagine that all this mathematical notation helps clarify the concept of the mean at all. In fact, it’s really just a fancy way of writing out the same thing I said in words: add all the values up, and then divide by the total number of items. However, that’s not really the reason I went into all that detail.</p></li>
<li><p>My goal was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we’ll be using throughout the book: <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> for the mean, <span class="math inline">\(\scriptstyle\sum\)</span> for the idea of summation, <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> for the total number of observations.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit, so it’s important that you understand them well enough to be able to “read” the equations, and to be able to see that it’s just saying “add up lots of things and then divide by another thing”.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> The median</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The second measure of central tendency that people use a lot is the <strong><em>median</em></strong>, and it’s even easier to describe than the mean. The median of a set of observations is just the middle value.</p></li>
<li><p>As before let’s imagine we were interested only in the first 5 animals: They sleep 12, 17, 14, 15, and 4 hours respectively. To figure out the median, we sort these numbers into ascending order:
<span class="math display">\[
4, 12, \color{red}{14}, 15, 17
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>From inspection, it’s obvious that the median value of these 5 observations is 32, since that’s the middle one in the sorted list (I’ve put it in red to make it even more obvious). Easy stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>But what should we do if we were interested in the first 6 animals rather than the first 5? Since the sixth animal sleeps for 14 hours, our sorted list is now:
<span class="math display">\[
4, 12, \color{red}{14}, \color{red}{14}, 15, 17
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>That’s also easy. It’s still 14.</p></li>
<li><p>But what we do if we were interested in the first 8 animals? Here is our new sorted list.
<span class="math display">\[
4,  7,  9, \color{red}{12}, \color{red}{14}, 14, 15, 17
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>There are now <em>two</em> middle numbers, 12 and 14. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which is of course 13.</p></li>
<li><p>To understand why, think of the median as the value that divides the sorted list of numbers into two halves – those on its left, and those on its right.</p></li>
<li><p>As before, it’s very tedious to do this by hand when you’ve got lots of numbers. To illustrate this, here’s what happens when you use R to sort all the sleep durations. First, I’ll use the <code>sort()</code> function to display the 83 numbers in increasing numerical order:</p></li>

<li>Because the vector is 83 elements long, the middle value is at position 42. This means that the median of this vector is 10. In real life, of course, no-one actually calculates the median by sorting the data and then looking for the middle value. In real life, we use the median command:</li>

In contrast, the median is the middle observation. Half of the observations are smaller, and half of the observations are larger.
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, and what that implies for when you should use each one. This is illustrated in Figure <a href="descriptives.html#fig:meanmedian">3.2</a> the mean is kind of like the “centre of gravity” of the data set, whereas the median is the “middle value” in the data. What this implies, as far as which one you should use, depends a little on what type of data you’ve got and what you’re trying to achieve. As a rough guide:</li>
</ul>
<!-- to-do: talk about scales
- If your data are nominal scale, you probably shouldn't be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it's probably best to use the mode (Section \@ref(mode)) instead. 
- If your data are ordinal scale, you're more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only makes use of the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are bigger), but doesn't depend on the precise numbers involved. That's exactly the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. The mean, on the other hand, makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it's not really appropriate for ordinal data.
- For interval and ratio scale data, either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you're trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage that it uses all the information in the data (which is useful when you don't have a lot of data), but it's very sensitive to extreme values, as we'll see in Section \@ref(trimmedmean).  

Let's expand on that last part a little. 
-->
<ul>
<li>One consequence is that there’s systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section <a href="#skewandkurtosis"><strong>??</strong></a>). This is illustrated in Figure <a href="descriptives.html#fig:meanmedian">3.2</a> notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the “body” of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the “tail” (where the extreme values are).</li>
<li>To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table: the average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If you’re interested in looking at the overall income at the table, the mean might be the right answer; but if you’re interested in what counts as a typical income at the table, the median would be a better choice here.</li>

<div id="trimmedmean" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5</span> Trimmed mean</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the fundamental rules of applied statistics is that the data are messy. Real life is never simple, and so the data sets that you obtain are never as straightforward as the statistical theory says.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This can have awkward consequences. To illustrate, consider this rather strange looking data set (nevermind what it represents):
<span class="math display">\[
-100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>If you were to observe this in a real life data set, you’d probably suspect that something funny was going on with the <span class="math inline">\(-100\)</span> value. It’s probably an <strong><em>outlier</em></strong>, a value that doesn’t really belong with the others. You might consider removing it from the data set entirely, and in this particular case I’d probably agree with that course of action.</p></li>
<li><p>In real life, however, you don’t always get such cut-and-dried examples. For instance, you might get this instead:
<span class="math display">\[
-15,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(-15\)</span> looks a bit suspicious, but not anywhere near as much as that <span class="math inline">\(-100\)</span> did. In this case, it’s a little trickier. It <em>might</em> be a legitimate observation, it might not.</p></li>
<li><p>When faced with a situation where some of the most extreme-valued observations might not be quite trustworthy, the mean is not necessarily a good measure of central tendency. It is highly sensitive to one or two extreme values, and is thus not considered to be a <strong><em>robust</em></strong> measure.</p></li>
<li><p>One remedy that we’ve seen is to use the median. A more general solution is to use a “trimmed mean”. To calculate a trimmed mean, what you do is “discard” the most extreme examples on both ends (i.e., the largest and the smallest), and then take the mean of everything else. The goal is to preserve the best characteristics of the mean and the median:</p>
<ul>
<li>just like a median, you aren’t highly influenced by extreme outliers, but …</li>
<li>like the mean, you “use” more than one of the observations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Generally, we describe a trimmed mean in terms of the percentage of observation on either side that are discarded. So, for instance, a 10% trimmed mean discards the largest 10% of the observations <em>and</em> the smallest 10% of the observations, and then takes the mean of the remaining 80% of the observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Not surprisingly, the 0% trimmed mean is just the regular mean, and the 50% trimmed mean is the median. In that sense, trimmed means provide a whole family of central tendency measures that span the range from the mean to the median.</p></li>
<li><p>For our toy example above, we have 10 observations, and so a 10% trimmed mean is calculated by ignoring the largest value (i.e., <code>12</code>) and the smallest value (i.e., <code>-15</code>) and taking the mean of the remaining values. First, let’s enter the data</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="descriptives.html#cb16-1"></a>dataset &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>( <span class="dv">-15</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">6</span>,<span class="dv">7</span>,<span class="dv">8</span>,<span class="dv">9</span>,<span class="dv">12</span> )</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, let’s calculate means and medians:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="descriptives.html#cb17-1"></a><span class="kw">mean</span>( dataset )</span></code></pre></div>

<pre><code>## [1] 5.5</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>That’s a fairly substantial difference, but I’m tempted to think that the mean is being influenced a bit too much by the extreme values at either end of the data set, especially the <span class="math inline">\(-15\)</span> one. So let’s just try trimming the mean a bit. If I take a 10% trimmed mean, we’ll drop the extreme values on either side, and take the mean of the rest:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="descriptives.html#cb21-1"></a><span class="kw">mean</span>( dataset, <span class="dt">trim =</span> <span class="fl">.1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.5</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In this case it gives exactly the same answer as the median. Note that, to get a 10% trimmed mean you write <code>trim = .1</code>, not <code>trim = 10</code>.</li>
