In the following, I will draw on the following resources. The pretty great introduction to R and statistics by Danielle Navarro available here. Matt Crump’s ‘Answering Questions with Data’. Bodo Winter’s ‘Statistics of Linguists: An Introduction Using R’ "],["scalesOfMeasurement.html", "Chapter 2 Scales of Measurement 2.1 Nominal scale 2.2 Ordinal scale 2.3 Interval scale 2.4 Ratio scale 2.5 Continuous versus discrete variables 2.6 Some complexities", " Chapter 2 Scales of Measurement (an adapted version of Danielle Navarro’s chapter 2.) (15 December, 2020, 22:01) As might recall, the outcome of a measurement is what we call a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type, and it’s very useful to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is what’s known as scales of measurement. 2.1 Nominal scale A nominal scale variable (also referred to as a categorical variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities. No ordering: For these kinds of variables it doesn’t make any sense to say that one of them is “bigger’ or “better” than any other one, and it doesn’t make any sense to average them. Examples: The classic example for this is “eye color”. Eyes can be blue, green and brown, among other possibilities, but none of them is any “better” than any other one. As a result, it would feel really odd to talk about an “average eye color”. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn’t better or worse than female, neither does it make sense to try to talk about an “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. That’s it. Let’s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose I was doing research on how people commute to and from work. One variable I would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This “transport type” variable could have quite a few possible values, including: “train”, “bus”, “car”, “bicycle”, etc. For now, let’s suppose that these four are the only possibilities, and suppose that when I ask 100 people how they got to work today, and I get this: Transportation Number of people (1) Train 12 (2) Bus 30 (3) Car 48 (4) Bicycle 10 So, what’s the average transportation type? Obviously, the answer here is that there isn’t one. It’s a silly question to ask. You can say that travel by car is the most popular method, and travel by train is the least popular method, but that’s about all. 2.2 Ordinal scale Ordinal scale variables have a bit more structure than nominal scale variables, but not by a lot. An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you can’t do anything else. Examples: The usual example given of an ordinal variable is “finishing position in a race”. You can say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don’t know how much faster. As a consequence we know that 1st &lt; 2nd, and we know that 2nd &lt; 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd. Here’s an more interesting example. Suppose I’m interested in people’s attitudes to climate change, and I ask them to pick one of these four statements that most closely matches their beliefs: Temperatures are rising, because of human activity Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are not rising These four statements actually do have a natural ordering, in terms of “the extent to which they agree with the current science”. Statement 1 is a close match, Statement 2 is a reasonable match, Statement 3 isn’t a very good match, Statement 4 is in strong opposition to the science. So, in terms of the thing I’m interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), I can order the items as \\(1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4\\). So, let’s suppose I asked 100 people these questions, and got the following answers: Response Number (1) Temperatures are rising, because of human activity 51 (2) Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why 20 (3) Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans 10 (4) Temperatures are not rising 19 When analysing these data, it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3) together, and say that 81 of 100 people were willing to at least partially endorse the science. And it’s also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 of 100 people registered at least some disagreement with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 of 100 people said what? There’s nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all. 2.3 Interval scale In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, interval scale and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables, the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesn’t have a “natural” zero value. Examples: A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees celsius. For instance, if it was 15° yesterday and 18° today, then the 3° difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3° difference is exactly the same as the 3° difference between 7° and 10°. In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables. (Nevermind that a change of 10° will feel different at 20° compared to 30°.) However, notice that the 0° does not mean “no temperature at all”: it actually means “the temperature at which water freezes”, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence, it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that 20° is twice as hot as 10°, just as it is weird and meaningless to try to claim that 20° is negative two times as hot as 10°. Or suppose I’m interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. Obviously, I’m going to want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely insane for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started “1.0024 times later” than the first one. That doesn’t make any sense at all. 2.4 Ratio scale The final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero really means zero, and it’s okay to multiply and divide. Example: A good example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In a lot of tasks it’s very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, because it’s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take \\(3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8\\) seconds longer than Alan did. Notice that multiplication and division also make sense here too: Ben took \\(3.1/2.3 = 1.35\\) times as long as Alan did to answer the question. The reason why you can do this is that, for a ratio scale variable such as RT, “zero seconds” really does mean “no time at all”. Scale Meaningful order Meaningful differences Meaningful ratio Nominal scale Ordinal scale x Interval scale x x Ratio scale x x x 2.5 Continuous versus discrete variables There’s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of, regarding what types of variables you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The difference between these is as follows: A continuous variable is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between. A discrete variable is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable, it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle. For exampl, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then it’s possible for Cameron’s response time to lie in between, by taking 3.0 seconds. And of course it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron’s and Alan’s. And while in practice it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it’s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones, we say that RT is continuous. Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete: there isn’t a type of transportation that falls “in between” trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete: although “2nd place” does fall between “1st place” and “3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall in between “1st place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete: since a true-or-false question doesn’t allow you to be “partially correct”, there’s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. 2.6 Some complexities Okay, I know you’re going to be shocked to hear this, but the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life actually fall into these nice neat categories, so you need to be kind of careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesn’t work like that: they’re guidelines, intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more. So let’s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the Likert scale. The humble Likert scale is the bread and butter tool of all survey design. You yourself have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands of them, and odds are you’ve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this: Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that “all pirates are freaking awesome” and then the options presented to the participant are these: Strongly disagree Disagree Neither agree nor disagree Agree Strongly agree This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale: people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it’s not necessary that all items be explicitly described. This is a perfectly good example of a 5-point Likert scale too: Strongly disagree Strongly agree Likert scales are very handy, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is, what kind of variable are they? They’re obviously discrete, since you can’t give a response of 2.5. They’re obviously not nominal scale, since the items are ordered; and they’re not ratio scale either, since there’s no natural zero. But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can’t really prove that the difference between “strongly agree” and “agree” is of the same size as the difference between “agree” and “neither agree nor disagree”. In fact, in everyday life it’s pretty obvious that they’re not the same at all. So this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice most participants do seem to take the whole “on a scale from 1 to 5” part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as if it were interval scale. It’s not interval scale, but in practice it’s close enough that we usually think of it as being quasi-interval scale. "],["descriptives.html", "Chapter 3 Descriptive Statistics 3.1 Measures of central tendency 3.2 Measures of variability", " Chapter 3 Descriptive Statistics (an adapted version of Danielle Navarro’s chapter 3/5 on descriptive statistics.) (15 December, 2020, 22:01) Any time that you get a new data set to look at, one of the first tasks that you have to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily understood fashion. This is what descriptive statistics (as opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people the term “statistics” is synonymous with descriptive statistics. Before going into any details, let’s take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive statistics. To do this, let’s load a dataset on sleep in mammals. mammalian_sleep &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/msleep_ggplot2.csv&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(name, sleep_total, bodywt) %&gt;% dplyr::rename(sleep_total_h = sleep_total, bodywt_kg = bodywt) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(sleep_total_h = round(sleep_total_h) ) head(mammalian_sleep) ## name sleep_total_h bodywt_kg ## 1 Cheetah 12 50.000 ## 2 Owl monkey 17 0.480 ## 3 Mountain beaver 14 1.350 ## 4 Greater short-tailed shrew 15 0.019 ## 5 Cow 4 600.000 ## 6 Three-toed sloth 14 3.850 There are three variables here, name, sleep_total_h and bodywt_kg. For each animal named in name, the sleep_total_h variable contains the average number of hours animals of this kind sleep per day. The variable bodywt_kg contains the average weight of that animal in kg. Let’s have a look at the sleep_total_h variable: print(mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h) ## [1] 12 17 14 15 4 14 9 7 10 3 5 9 10 12 10 8 9 17 5 18 4 20 3 3 10 ## [26] 11 15 12 10 2 3 6 6 8 10 3 19 10 14 14 13 12 20 15 11 8 14 8 4 10 ## [51] 16 10 14 9 10 11 12 14 4 6 11 18 5 13 9 10 8 11 11 17 14 16 13 9 9 ## [76] 16 4 16 9 5 6 12 10 This output doesn’t make it easy to get a sense of what the data are actually saying. Just “looking at the data” isn’t a terribly effective way of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what’s going on, we need to calculate some descriptive statistics and draw some nice pictures. Let’s take a look at a histogram of these data: A histogram is a graphical representation of the frequencies of different values of ranges of values in the data. mammalian_sleep %&gt;% ggplot(aes(sleep_total_h)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) Figure 3.1: A histogram of the average amount of sleep by animal (the sleep_total_h variable). As you might expect, the larger the margin the less frequently you tend to see it. 3.1 Measures of central tendency Drawing pictures of the data, as I did in Figure 3.1 is an excellent way to convey the “gist” of what the data is trying to tell you, it’s often extremely useful to try to condense the data into a few simple “summary” statistics. In most situations, the first thing that you’ll want to calculate is a measure of central tendency. That is, you’d like to know something about the “average” or “middle” of your data lies. The two most commonly used measures are the mean, median and mode; occasionally people will also report a trimmed mean. I’ll explain each of these in turn, and then discuss when each of them is useful. 3.1.1 The mean The mean of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned average: add all of the values up, and then divide by the total number of values. The first five animals’ typical amount of sleep is 12 + 17 + 14 + 15 + 4, so the mean of these observations is just: \\[ \\frac{12 + 17 + 14 + 15 + 4}{5} = \\frac{62.4}{5} = 12.48 \\] Of course, this definition of the mean isn’t news to anyone: averages (i.e., means) are used so often in everyday life that this is pretty familiar stuff. However, since the concept of a mean is something that everyone already understands, I’ll use this as an excuse to start introducing some of the mathematical notation that statisticians use to describe this calculation, and talk about how the calculations would be done in R. The first piece of notation to introduce is \\(N\\), which we’ll use to refer to the number of observations that we’re averaging (in this case \\(N = 5\\)). Next, we need to attach a label to the observations themselves. It’s traditional to use \\(X\\) for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we’re actually talking about. That is, we’ll use \\(X_1\\) to refer to the first observation, \\(X_2\\) to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to \\(X_N\\) for the last one. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly more abstract way, we use \\(X_i\\) to refer to the \\(i\\)-th observation. Just to make sure we’re clear on the notation, the following table lists the 5 observations in the sleep_total_h variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it, and the actual value that the observation corresponds to: the observation its symbol the observed value Cheetah (animal 1) \\(X_1\\) 12 hours Owl monkey (animal 2) \\(X_2\\) 17 hours Mountain beaver (animal 3) \\(X_3\\) 14 hours Greater short-tailed shrew (animal 4) \\(X_4\\) 15 hours Cow (animal 5) \\(X_5\\) 4 hours Okay, now let’s try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use \\(\\bar{X}\\) as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N} \\] This formula is entirely correct, but it’s terribly long, so we make use of the summation symbol \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) to shorten it.1 If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, \\(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5\\) or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i \\] Taken literally, this could be read as “the sum, taken over all \\(i\\) values from 1 to 5, of the value \\(X_i\\)”. But basically, what it means is “add up the first five observations”. In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\] In all honesty, I can’t imagine that all this mathematical notation helps clarify the concept of the mean at all. In fact, it’s really just a fancy way of writing out the same thing I said in words: add all the values up, and then divide by the total number of items. However, that’s not really the reason I went into all that detail. My goal was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we’ll be using throughout the book: \\(\\bar{X}\\) for the mean, \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) for the idea of summation, \\(X_i\\) for the \\(i\\)th observation, and \\(N\\) for the total number of observations. We’re going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit, so it’s important that you understand them well enough to be able to “read” the equations, and to be able to see that it’s just saying “add up lots of things and then divide by another thing”. 3.1.2 Calculating the mean in R Okay that’s the maths, how do we get the magic computing box to do the work for us? If you really wanted to, you could do this calculation directly in R. For the first numbers, do this just by typing it in as if R were a calculator… (12 + 17 + 14 + 15 + 4) / 5 ## [1] 12.4 … in which case R outputs the answer 36.6, just as if it were a calculator. However, we learned quicker ways of doing that sum( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h[1:5] )/ 5 ## [1] 12.4 # or: mean( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h[1:5] ) ## [1] 12.4 3.1.3 The median The second measure of central tendency that people use a lot is the median, and it’s even easier to describe than the mean. The median of a set of observations is just the middle value. As before let’s imagine we were interested only in the first 5 animals: They sleep 12, 17, 14, 15, and 4 hours respectively. To figure out the median, we sort these numbers into ascending order: \\[ 4, 12, \\color{red}{14}, 15, 17 \\] From inspection, it’s obvious that the median value of these 5 observations is 32, since that’s the middle one in the sorted list (I’ve put it in red to make it even more obvious). Easy stuff. But what should we do if we were interested in the first 6 animals rather than the first 5? Since the sixth animal sleeps for 14 hours, our sorted list is now: \\[ 4, 12, \\color{red}{14}, \\color{red}{14}, 15, 17 \\] That’s also easy. It’s still 14. But what we do if we were interested in the first 8 animals? Here is our new sorted list. \\[ 4, 7, 9, \\color{red}{12}, \\color{red}{14}, 14, 15, 17 \\] There are now two middle numbers, 12 and 14. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which is of course 13. To understand why, think of the median as the value that divides the sorted list of numbers into two halves – those on its left, and those on its right. As before, it’s very tedious to do this by hand when you’ve got lots of numbers. To illustrate this, here’s what happens when you use R to sort all the sleep durations. First, I’ll use the sort() function to display the 83 numbers in increasing numerical order: sort( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h ) ## [1] 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 8 8 8 8 8 ## [26] 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 11 11 ## [51] 11 12 12 12 12 12 12 13 13 13 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 15 15 15 16 16 16 16 ## [76] 17 17 17 18 18 19 20 20 Because the vector is 83 elements long, the middle value is at position 42. This means that the median of this vector is 10. In real life, of course, no-one actually calculates the median by sorting the data and then looking for the middle value. In real life, we use the median command: median( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h ) ## [1] 10 which outputs the median value of 10. 3.1.4 Mean or median? What’s the difference? Figure 3.2: An illustration of the difference between how the mean and the median should be interpreted. The mean is basically the “centre of gravity” of the data set: if you imagine that the histogram of the data is a solid object, then the point on which you could balance it (as if on a see-saw) is the mean. In contrast, the median is the middle observation. Half of the observations are smaller, and half of the observations are larger. Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, and what that implies for when you should use each one. This is illustrated in Figure 3.2 the mean is kind of like the “centre of gravity” of the data set, whereas the median is the “middle value” in the data. What this implies, as far as which one you should use, depends a little on what type of data you’ve got and what you’re trying to achieve. As a rough guide: One consequence is that there’s systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section ??). This is illustrated in Figure 3.2 notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the “body” of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the “tail” (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table: the average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If you’re interested in looking at the overall income at the table, the mean might be the right answer; but if you’re interested in what counts as a typical income at the table, the median would be a better choice here. 3.1.5 Trimmed mean One of the fundamental rules of applied statistics is that the data are messy. Real life is never simple, and so the data sets that you obtain are never as straightforward as the statistical theory says.2 This can have awkward consequences. To illustrate, consider this rather strange looking data set (nevermind what it represents): \\[ -100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \\] If you were to observe this in a real life data set, you’d probably suspect that something funny was going on with the \\(-100\\) value. It’s probably an outlier, a value that doesn’t really belong with the others. You might consider removing it from the data set entirely, and in this particular case I’d probably agree with that course of action. In real life, however, you don’t always get such cut-and-dried examples. For instance, you might get this instead: \\[ -15,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12 \\] The \\(-15\\) looks a bit suspicious, but not anywhere near as much as that \\(-100\\) did. In this case, it’s a little trickier. It might be a legitimate observation, it might not. When faced with a situation where some of the most extreme-valued observations might not be quite trustworthy, the mean is not necessarily a good measure of central tendency. It is highly sensitive to one or two extreme values, and is thus not considered to be a robust measure. One remedy that we’ve seen is to use the median. A more general solution is to use a “trimmed mean”. To calculate a trimmed mean, what you do is “discard” the most extreme examples on both ends (i.e., the largest and the smallest), and then take the mean of everything else. The goal is to preserve the best characteristics of the mean and the median: just like a median, you aren’t highly influenced by extreme outliers, but … like the mean, you “use” more than one of the observations. Generally, we describe a trimmed mean in terms of the percentage of observation on either side that are discarded. So, for instance, a 10% trimmed mean discards the largest 10% of the observations and the smallest 10% of the observations, and then takes the mean of the remaining 80% of the observations. Not surprisingly, the 0% trimmed mean is just the regular mean, and the 50% trimmed mean is the median. In that sense, trimmed means provide a whole family of central tendency measures that span the range from the mean to the median. For our toy example above, we have 10 observations, and so a 10% trimmed mean is calculated by ignoring the largest value (i.e., 12) and the smallest value (i.e., -15) and taking the mean of the remaining values. First, let’s enter the data dataset &lt;- c( -15,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12 ) Next, let’s calculate means and medians: mean( dataset ) ## [1] 4.1 median( dataset ) ## [1] 5.5 That’s a fairly substantial difference, but I’m tempted to think that the mean is being influenced a bit too much by the extreme values at either end of the data set, especially the \\(-15\\) one. So let’s just try trimming the mean a bit. If I take a 10% trimmed mean, we’ll drop the extreme values on either side, and take the mean of the rest: mean( dataset, trim = .1) ## [1] 5.5 In this case it gives exactly the same answer as the median. Note that, to get a 10% trimmed mean you write trim = .1, not trim = 10. 3.1.6 Mode The mode is the last measure of central tendency we’ll look at. It is very simple: it is the value that occurs most frequently. Let’s look at the some soccer data: specifically, the European Cup and Champions League results in the time from 1955-2016. Lets find out which team has won the most matches.

That doesn’t come as a surprise even to me. Of course, the mode is the right (and only) summary for nominal variables. But we can compute a mode for all types of variables. For example, let’s take a look at the mean, median, and mode of the total number of goals per game. champs %&lt;&gt;% mutate(total_goals = hgoal + vgoal) # total goals is home team goals + visitor goals mean(champs$total_goals) ## [1] 2.81642 median(champs$total_goals) ## [1] 3 modeOf(champs$total_goals) ## [1] 2 mean_goals &lt;- mean(champs$total_goals) median_goals &lt;- median(champs$total_goals) mode_goals &lt;- modeOf(champs$total_goals) ggplot(champs, aes(total_goals)) + geom_histogram() + geom_vline(xintercept = mean_goals, color = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = median_goals, color = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = mode_goals, color = &quot;green&quot;) + geom_text(data=NULL, x = mean_goals-.6, y=1470, label = &quot;mean&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_text(data=NULL, x = median_goals+.75, y=1500, label = &quot;median&quot;, color = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_text(data=NULL, x = mode_goals-.6, y=1530, label = &quot;mode&quot;, color = &quot;green&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. 3.1.7 Summary There are multiple measures of central tendency that can be used to summarize an aspect of a distribution: _ (arithmetic) mean, median, and mode_. They answer different questions about distribution. For example, in the distribution of number of goals per game in the previous section mean: “If the same number of goals were scored in each game, how many goals would be scored?” median: “What is a ‘mediocre’ game like?” mode: “What is the most typical game like?” 3.2 Measures of variability The statistics that we’ve discussed so far all relate to central tendency. That is, they all talk about which values are “in the middle” or “popular” in the data. The second thing that we really want is a measure of the variability of the data. That is, how “spread out” are the data? In other words, how ‘representative’ is our measure of central tendency of most data points. Let’s consider interval and ratio scale data. 3.2.1 Range The range of a variable is very simple: it’s the biggest value minus the smallest value. For the sleep data, the maximum value is 20, and the minimum value is 2. We can calculate these values in R using the max() and min() functions: max( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h ) ## [1] 20 min( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h ) ## [1] 2 where I’ve omitted the output because it’s not interesting. The other possibility is to use the range() function; which outputs both the minimum value and the maximum value in a vector, like this: range( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h ) ## [1] 2 20 Although the range is the simplest way to quantify the notion of “variability”, it’s one of the worst. Recall from our discussion of the mean that we want our summary measure to be robust. If the data set has one or two extremely bad values in it, we’d like our statistics not to be unduly influenced by these cases. If we look once again at our toy example of a data set containing very extreme outliers… \\[ -100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \\] … it is clear that the range is not robust, since this has a range of 110, but if the outlier were removed we would have a range of only 8. 3.2.2 Quantiles and percentile A key concept we will need to build on to conceptualize several other measures of variability are quantiles or percentiles. A percentile is the smallest value in a dataset such that a set percentage is smaller than it. (A quantile does pretty much the same but is more generic.) For example, if the 10-th percentile (i.e., the \\(0.1\\) quantile) of a list of values is 73, this means that 10 percent of the values are smaller than or equal to 73. Let’s take a look at the 20 shortest sorted sleep durations and determine the 10-th percentile (\\(0.1\\) quantile), 30-th percentile (\\(0.3\\) quantile), 50-th percentile (\\(0.5\\) quantile), and the 90-th percentile (\\(0.9\\) quantile). Here are the values: sort(mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h)[1:20] ## [1] 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 And here is a sorted plot of the 20 smallest values: quantile &lt;- c(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.9) quantile_points &lt;- c(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.9)*20 quantile_labels &lt;- sprintf(&quot;%0.1f quantile\\n(point %d of 20)&quot;, quantile, quantile_points) ggplot(data=NULL, aes(x=1:20, y=sort(mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h)[1:20])) + geom_point() + geom_vline(xintercept = quantile_points) + geom_label(aes(x=quantile_points, y=6.5, label=quantile_labels )) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:20) + xlab(&quot;Position in ordered vector&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Sleep (hours)&quot;) As you can see: 10-th percentile (\\(0.1\\) quantile): 3 [to be found at position 2, since 2 data points constitute 10 percent of the data] 30-th percentile (\\(0.3\\) quantile): 3 [to be found at position 6, since 6 data points constitute 30 percent of the data] 50-th percentile (\\(0.5\\) quantile): 4 [to be found at position 10, since 10 data points constitute 50 percent of the data] 90-th percentile (\\(0.9\\) quantile): 6 [to be found at position 18, since 18 data points constitute 90 percent of the data] The 50-th percentile is the median. 3.2.3 Interquartile range The interquartile range (IQR) is like the range, but instead of calculating the difference between the biggest and smallest value, it calculates the difference between the 25th quantile and the 75th quantile. R provides you with a way of calculating quantiles, using the (surprise, surprise) quantile() function. Let’s use it to calculate the median sleep durations: quantile( x = mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h, probs = .5) ## 50% ## 10 And not surprisingly, this agrees with the answer that we saw earlier with the median() function. Now, we can actually input lots of quantiles at once, by specifying a vector for the probs argument. So lets do that, and get the 25th and 75th percentile: quantile( x = mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h, probs = c(.25,.75) ) ## 25% 75% ## 8 14 And, by noting that \\(14 - 8 = 6\\), we can see that the interquartile range for the sleep durations is 6. Of course, that seems like too much work to do all that typing, so R has a built in function called IQR() that we can use: IQR( x = mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h ) ## [1] 6 While it’s obvious how to interpret the range, it’s a little less obvious how to interpret the IQR. The simplest way to think about it is like this: the interquartile range is the range spanned by the “middle half” of the data. That is, one quarter of the data falls below the 25th percentile, one quarter of the data is above the 75th percentile, leaving the “middle half” of the data lying in between the two. And the IQR is the range covered by that middle half. 3.2.4 Mean absolute deviation The range and the interquartile range, both rely on the idea that we can measure the spread of the data by looking at the quantiles of the data. However, this isn’t the only way to think about the problem. A different approach is to select a meaningful reference point (usually the mean or the median) and then report the “typical” deviations from that reference point. Let’s go through the mean absolute deviation (AAD for average absolute deviation, since MAD is reserved for the median absolute deviation) from the mean a little more slowly. One useful thing about this measure is that the name actually tells you exactly how to calculate it: \\[ AAD(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N |X_i - \\bar{X}| \\] Let’s compute the AAD for the first data points in the sleep data: \\[ 12, 17, 14, 15, 4 \\] The mean of the dataset is 12.4. That is, \\(\\bar{X} = 12.4\\) The deviations \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) are: \\[ -0.4, 4.6, 1.6, 2.6, -8.4 \\] The absolute deviations \\(|X_i - \\bar{X}|\\) are: \\[ 0.4, 4.6, 1.6, 2.6, 8.4 \\] The sum of the absolute deviations \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^N |X_i - \\bar{X}|\\) is 17.6. And \\(N=5\\), which means, that, in our case: \\(AAD(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N |X_i - \\bar{X}| = 3.52\\) In R, we can compute it for the entire vector. mean_sleep &lt;- mean(mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h) deviation_sleep &lt;- mean_sleep - mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h mean( abs(deviation_sleep) ) ## [1] 3.576717 An alternative, more compact way to write it is using (lots) pipes: mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h %&gt;% subtract(., mean(.)) %&gt;% abs() %&gt;% mean() ## [1] 3.576717 The interpretation of the AAD is quite straightforward: It is the average distance from the average. When it’s big, the values are quite spread out. When it’s small, they are close. The units are the same (hours in our case). 3.2.5 Variance Although the mean absolute deviation measure has its uses, it’s not the best measure of variability to use. For a number of practical reasons, there are some solid reasons to prefer squared deviations rather than absolute deviations. A measure of variability based on squared deviations has a number of useful properties in inferential statistics and statistical modeling.3 If we do that, we obtain a measure is called the variance, which for a specific set of observations \\(X\\) is written \\(\\mbox{s}_X^2\\). It is the most wide-spread measure of variability because it is a key concept in inferential statistics. The formula that we use to calculate the variance of a set of observations is as follows: \\[ \\mbox{s}_X^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 \\] As you can see, it’s basically the same formula that we used to calculate the mean absolute deviation, except that: Instead of using “absolute deviations” we use “squared deviations”. Instead of dividing by \\(N\\) (which gives us the average deviation), we divide by \\(N-1\\) (which gives us ‘sort-of-the-average’). [We will talk about this in a little while.] Now that we’ve got the basic idea, let’s have a look at a concrete example. Once again, let’s use the first five sleep durations. If we follow the same approach that we took last time, we end up with the following table: Table 3.1: Regular, abssolute, and squared deviations Notation [English] \\(i\\) [animal] \\(X_i\\) [value] \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) [deviation from mean] \\((X_i - \\bar{X})^2\\) [squared deviation] 1 12 -0.4 0.16 2 17 4.6 21.16 3 14 1.6 2.56 4 15 2.6 6.76 5 4 -8.4 70.56 That last column contains all of our squared deviations, so all we have to do is average them. If we do that by typing all the numbers into R by hand… ( 0.16+21.16+2.56+6.76+70.56 ) / (5-1) ## [1] 25.3 We end up with a variance of 25.3. Exciting, isn’t it? For the moment, let’s ignore the burning question that you’re all probably thinking (i.e., what the heck does a variance of 25.3 actually mean?) and instead talk a bit more about how to do the calculations in R. As always, we want to avoid having to type in a whole lot of numbers ourselves. And as it happens, we have the vector X lying around, which we created in the previous section. With this in mind, we can calculate the variance of X by using the following command, X &lt;- mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h[1:5] (X - mean(X) )^2 / (length(X) - 1) ## [1] 0.04 5.29 0.64 1.69 17.64 and as usual we get the same answer as the one that we got when we did everything by hand. However, I still think that this is too much typing. Fortunately, R has a built in function called var() which does calculate variances. So we could also do this… var(X) ## [1] 25.3 and you get the same answer. Great. 3.2.6 Standard deviation One problem with the variance is that it is expressed in odd units. In the case above it’s \\(h^2\\) (hours squared). I know what \\(m^2\\), but what are \\(h^2\\)? No idea. Suppose that you’d like to have a measure that is expressed in the same units as the data itself (i.e., points, not points-squared). What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious: take the square root of the variance, known as the standard deviation, also called the “root mean squared deviation”, or RMSD. This solves out problem fairly neatly. While nobody has a clue what “a variance of 19.95 hours-squared” really means, it’s much easier to understand “a standard deviation of 4.5 hours”, since it’s expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as \\(s_x\\), though “sd” and “std dev.” are also used at times. Because the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance, you probably won’t be surprised to see that the formula is: \\[ s_x = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 } \\] \\[ \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 } \\] With that in mind, calculating standard deviations in R is simple: sd( mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h ) ## [1] 4.466777 Interpreting standard deviations is slightly more complex. Because the standard deviation is derived from the variance, and the variance is a quantity that has little to no meaning that makes sense to us humans, the standard deviation doesn’t have a simple interpretation. As a consequence, most of us just rely on a simple rule of thumb: “in general, you should expect 68% of the data to fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the data to fall within 2 standard deviation of the mean, and 99.7% of the data to fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean”. This rule tends to work pretty well most of the time, but it’s not exact: it’s actually calculated based on an assumption that the histogram is symmetric and “bell shaped”. (Strictly, the assumption is that the data are normally distributed, which is an important concept that we’ll discuss more later). p &lt;- mammalian_sleep %&gt;% ggplot(aes(sleep_total_h)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) sleep_sd &lt;- sd(mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h) sleep_mean &lt;- mean(mammalian_sleep$sleep_total_h) bars &lt;- c(sleep_mean-sleep_sd, sleep_mean, sleep_mean+sleep_sd) bar_labels &lt;- c(&quot;mean-1*sd&quot;, &quot;mean&quot;, &quot;mean+1*sd&quot;) p &lt;- p + geom_vline(xintercept = bars, color = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_label(data=NULL, aes(x=bars[1], y= 10, label = bar_labels[1])) + geom_label(data=NULL, aes(x=bars[2], y= 10, label = bar_labels[2])) + geom_label(data=NULL, aes(x=bars[3], y= 10, label = bar_labels[3])) p Figure 3.3: An illustration of the standard deviation. with(mammalian_sleep, mean(sleep_total_h&gt;(sleep_mean-sleep_sd) &amp; sleep_total_h&lt;(sleep_mean+sleep_sd) )) ## [1] 0.6385542 3.2.6.1 Bessel’s correction: What’s up with all those \\(N-1\\)s in the denominator? Now, what’s going on with that \\(N-1\\), and why do I still call the sample variance a ‘sort-of-the-average’ of the squared deviations? Let’s address these questions in turn. The important thing to note about variance and standard deviation is they serve two purposes: They are used to (i) describe a sample, but also to (ii) tentatively characterize the larger population from which the sample is. You are usually not really interested in the variance of a particular set of numbers, but rather in what they represent. So function number (ii) is the far more dominant use. In our case, when I want to quantify the variability of the sleep durations dataset, it is not these 83 specific mammals I am interested in – I want to get a sense of the variability among mammals in general. That is, I want to know – how much do mammals vary in general. These just happen to be a sample (83 mammals) from the population (all mammals). What I actually want to compute are not the (squared) deviations from the sample mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\); the average sleep duration of these mammals), but from the actual population mean (\\(\\mu\\); the average sleep duration of all mammals). That is, I don’t want \\(( X_i - \\bar{X})^2\\), I want \\(( X_i - \\mu)^2\\). But I don’t know \\(\\mu\\), and the best guess I have about it is \\(\\bar{X}\\). And this has consequences: \\(( X_i - \\bar{X})^2\\) underestimates the distance between \\(X_i\\) and \\(\\mu\\) because we use the same data points (\\(X_i\\)) to compute the mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) and then determine the distance to them. Consider what happens to \\(( X_i - \\bar{X})^2\\) in the rather extreme cases of \\(N=1\\)? – The distance is zero. \\(N=2\\)? – If both points happen to be The problem becomes smaller as \\(N\\) increases, because it becomes less and less likely that all \\(N\\) points are squarely on one side of the mean. Dividing by \\(N-1\\) ‘corrects’ this underestimation problem: Dividing by a smaller number makes the estimate of the variance bigger. As \\(N\\) increases the difference between dividing by \\(N\\) and \\(N-1\\) becomes less and less important, and ultimately negligible. 3.2.6.1.1 Summary To recap, these are the two estimators of the variance, but the second one requires knowledge of the true population mean \\(\\mu\\), which we don’t know. Therefore, we use the first one (\\(s_X^2\\)), and divide by \\(N-1\\) to avoid underestimating the ‘true variance’. \\[ \\mbox{s}_X^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 \\] \\[ \\mbox{Var}_X = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\mu \\right)^2 \\] output: pdf_document: default html_document: default editor_options: chunk_output_type: console — The choice to use \\(\\Sigma\\) to denote summation isn’t arbitrary: it’s the Greek upper case letter sigma, which is the analogue of the letter S in that alphabet. Similarly, there’s an equivalent symbol used to denote the multiplication of lots of numbers: because multiplications are also called “products”, we use the \\(\\Pi\\) symbol for this; the Greek upper case pi, which is the analogue of the letter P.↩ Or at least, the basic statistical theory – these days there is a whole subfield of statistics called robust statistics that tries to grapple with the messiness of real data and develop theory that can cope with it.↩ I will very briefly mention the one that I think is coolest, for a very particular definition of “cool”, that is. Variances are additive. Here’s what that means: suppose I have two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), whose variances are \\(\\mbox{Var}(X)\\) and \\(\\mbox{Var}(Y)\\) respectively. Now imagine I want to define a new variable \\(Z\\) that is the sum of the two, \\(Z = X+Y\\). As it turns out, the variance of \\(Z\\) is equal to \\(\\mbox{Var}(X) + \\mbox{Var}(Y)\\). This is a very useful property, but it’s not true of the other measures that I talk about in this section.↩ "],["errorless-lms.html", "Chapter 4 Error-less Linear Models 4.1 Single-variable models 4.2 Multi-variable models 4.3 Models with categorical predictors 4.4 Centered predictors 4.5 Main effects and interactions 4.6 Centered predictors and their effect on main effect and interaction coefficients", " Chapter 4 Error-less Linear Models What I am going to call ‘error-less linear models’ are actually systems of linear equations like those you might recall from school (of the ‘2=a+3x; 1=a+x; solve for a and x’-variety). I’ll call them error-less linear models, because in many important ways they resemble the class of statistical models we will use in this course: (Generalized) Linear Models. In this section we are going to explore error-less linear models, i.e. linear models that work on idealized data, when there is no measurement error, and when the ‘correct’ model describing the data is known.

The predictors \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots\\) can be independent variables (i.e., under experimental control), or other types of covariates (i.e., simply observed). The model is called linear because \\(y\\) is assumed to be a linear function of the \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots\\). That \\(y\\) increases by some fixed amount \\(\\Delta y\\) for every increase of \\(\\Delta x_i\\) in \\(x_i\\). Two types are usually distinguished: single-variable, and multi-variable (also: simple linear regression, multiple linear regression). The above equation is about vectors of observations. Let’s see how it translates to statements about specific observations. Please note that \\(Y\\), \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\) in the equation above are all vectors, while \\(y_i\\), \\(x_{1,i}\\), \\(x_{2,i}\\) are all specific numbers (from the \\(i\\)-th row). \\[ \\underbrace{y_i}_{\\text{dependent variable}} = \\overbrace{\\underbrace{a}_{\\text{intercept}}}^{\\text{additive term}} + \\overbrace{\\underbrace{b_1}_{\\text{slope}} * \\underbrace{x_{1,i}}_{\\text{predictor}}}^{\\text{additive term}} + \\overbrace{\\underbrace{b_2}_{\\text{slope}} * \\underbrace{x_{2,i} }_{\\text{predictor}}}^{\\text{additive term}} + \\ldots\\] For two predictors \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), and three observerations like in the table above, this equation translates to the following equation system \\[ y_1 = a + b_1\\cdot x_{1,1} + b_2\\cdot x_{2,1} \\\\ y_2 = a + b_1\\cdot x_{1,2} + b_2\\cdot x_{2,3} \\\\ y_3 = a + b_1\\cdot x_{1,3} + b_2\\cdot x_{2,3}\\] That is, \\[ 2.95 = a + b_1\\cdot 1.1 + b_2\\cdot 2.2 \\\\ 9.1 = a + b_1\\cdot 2.9 + b_2\\cdot (-4) \\\\ 5 = a + b_1\\cdot 3.1 + b_2\\cdot (-1.4)\\] In this case, there is a perfect solution: \\(a \\approx 7.90\\), \\(b_1 \\approx -1.60\\), \\(b_2 \\approx -1.45\\) (rounded to two decimal places). \\[ \\underbrace{y}_{\\text{dependent variable}} = \\overbrace{\\underbrace{7.9}_{\\text{intercept}}}^{\\text{additive term}} + \\overbrace{\\underbrace{(-1.60)}_{\\text{slope}} * \\underbrace{x_1}_{\\text{predictor}}}^{\\text{additive term}} + \\overbrace{\\underbrace{(-1.45)}_{\\text{slope}} * \\underbrace{x_2}_{\\text{predictor}}}^{\\text{additive term}} + \\ldots\\] model prediction dependent variable predictor 1 predictor 2 (further predictors) \\(7.9-1.6\\cdot 1.1-1.45\\cdot 2.2\\) 2.95 1.1 2.2 (…) \\(7.9-1.6\\cdot 2.9-1.45\\cdot (-4)\\) 9.1 2.9 -4.0 (…) \\(7.9-1.6\\cdot 3.1-1.45\\cdot (-1.4)\\) 5 3.1 -1.4 (…) … … … (…) Throughout this course, we will make use of the (Generalized) Linear Model as the main statistical model because it is: fairly easy to use (implemented in most programming languages) sufficiently versatile for most practical purposes (can handle most problems you would want to solve at this point) well-studied (all mistakes you will make have already been made, and written about) 4.1 Single-variable models Let’s take a look at a dataset of taxi rides in a country far far away. Imagine that I don’t speak the local language, but I need to go places, and in the process, I would like to understand how the cab fare system works. I have taken 18 taxi rides, and recorded the travel distance, as well as the taxi fare for reach ride. The following plot shows each of these measurements as a point with the distances (in km) on the x-axis, and the fare (money units, MU) on the y-axis. This dataset is interesting, because you probably understand the typical relationships between ride distance and fare fairly well – it is linear. So it is an ideal example for illustrating linear models. Unsurprisingly, we can see clearly that the fare increases with distance. In other words, distance and fare have a positive relationship (if one increases, so does the other). The relationship between the two variables is so strong that if we know the value of one of the two variables for a particular data point, we can predict the value of the other with a high degree of confidence. (You might want to say that I can predict if with absolute certainty, but that presupposes precise knowledge of the cab fare system in that city, and an extreme degree of trust towards the local taxi drivers. Let’s assume that we don’t have either.) We can make that prediction with such a high degree of certainty because all the points seem to lie on a line. If we learned the function that describes this line, we could learn much more from this dataset than the simple fact that the two variables a positive related. That is unsurprising to begin with, but we may want to know how exactly they are related. A simple way to capture this relationship is to try and describe it with this function: \\[ \\text{fare} = a + b \\cdot \\text{distance} \\] What this equation says is that if we take a value for distance, multiply it by some number called \\(b\\), and then add another number called \\(a\\), we will know the fare that corresponds to this distance. (In other words, this equation posits that the relationship between distance and fare is linear.4) In this particular case the relationship is \\(\\text{fare} = 4 + 2.5 \\cdot \\text{distance}\\), which means that \\(a=4\\), and \\(b=2.5\\). We can verify that this equation is indeed the correct generalization by visualizing this function as a line in the plot below: As you can see, it accurately describes all the points in the graph. Importantly, if we conceptualize \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as just some numbers that we need to add and multiply by, we will miss an important insight: Both numbers have useful interpretations. In this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be interpreted as follows: \\(a\\) is called the intercept: It can be interpreted as the value of fare when distance is 0. In this case, the intercept is \\(4~MU\\), which is the amount you have to pay if you get in and change your mind after the taxometer has been switched on (if the taxi driver is a real stickler for rules). \\(b\\) is called the slope for distance: It can be interpreted as the additional amount of money you have to pay for every additional kilometer traveled. A slope of \\(2.5\\) means that a distance increase of \\(1~km\\) increases the fare by \\(2.5~MU\\). The plot below illustrates these interpretations: 4.2 Multi-variable models Let’s imagine that this imaginary city also has many bridges. Since I wasn’t sure whether bridge tolls apply, I also recorded the number of bridges crossed on each trip. In the previous section, we’ve looked at the subset of data where no bridges were crossed. Let’s see how the fare depends not only on distance travelled, but also on the number of bridges crossed. Now, we are looking at the relationship between three variables, and the data frame looks as follows: Let’s see if there even is a relationship. Let’s look at the effect of bridges at distance=\\(3\\,km\\). Yup, it looks like there is a positive effect. Let’s model it in additive fashion: We will again assume that the relationships between fare and distance, as well as between fare and number of bridges crossed is linear, and that they contribute to the fare independently. We can now describe the relationship with the following equation: \\[ fare = a + b_1 \\cdot distance + b_2 \\cdot N_{bridges} \\] The correct parameter values for this equation are \\(a=4\\), \\(b_1 = 2.5\\) (as previously), and \\(b_2=5\\). The interpretation of the coefficients is similar to the previous section: \\(a\\) (the intercept) is the fare when no bridges have been crossed, and the travel distance is zero.5 \\(b_1\\) (the slope for distance) is the additional fare for every additional kilometer. \\(b_2\\) (the slope for \\(N_{bridges}\\)) is the additional fare for every additional bridge. The following plot shows the data vis-à-vis the linear model fits. You can turn the plot in the browser. Drag it around using your mouse. Because we are dealing with a relationship between three variables, every datapoint is a point in three-dimensional space (x-axis: distance, y-axis: number of bridges, z-axis: fare). The multi-variable model fit is illustrated by the blue plane perfectly fitting through all points, which rises with increasing distance and/or number of bridges crossed. The green plane below shows the single-variable model from the last section (\\(fare = 4 + 2.5\\cdot distance\\)) for comparison. The plane corresponding to the single-variable model does not rise with the number of bridges crossed. This is because it is not used as a predictor in that model. You will also notice that the red plane and the black plane intersect in a line at \\(N_{bridges} = 0\\). This is because the two model equations \\(a + b_1 * distance\\) and \\(a + b_1 * distance + b_2 * N_{bridges}\\) are equivalent for \\(N_{bridges} = 0\\). 4.3 Models with categorical predictors Predictors on the nominal or ordinal scale (as opposed to ratio, or interval scale) are not naturally represented by numbers. For example: Speaker gender Presence or absence of wh-movement word order (e.g., SOV, SVO, VSO) size (long, short) We can represent them numerically, but there are many coding options. We can represent a factor with two levels by (i) 0 and 1, or (ii) by -1 and 1, or (iii) by +0.5 and -0.5, or even (iv) 23 and 42. In the case of the taxi fares, one such predictor is the color of the taxi: I’ve observed red and yellow taxis, and I didn’t know if there is possibly a difference in their pricing. In order to determine whether there is, I decided to take a ride in both types. (All the data in the previous sections was for yellow cabs only.) The following plot shows the relationship between fare and cab color (for \\(distance=10~km\\), and \\(N_{bridges} = 0\\)). The x-axis shows the contrast for cab color (the numerical representation of of the categorical variable ‘color’). The y-axis shows the cab fare. While the choice of the coding scheme is somewhat arbitrary, it will affect the interpretation of the coefficients (that is, the parameters of the linear model, i.e., the intercept and the slope). In other words, model parameterization (or: contrast specification) affects the meaning of the coefficients. We will use equation (4.1) to describe the relationship, where cCabColorRed is a numerical representation of the cab color. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{fare} = a + b \\cdot \\text{cCabColorRed} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] We will consider two ways representing color: treatment contrasts, sum contrasts. For the interpretations of the coefficients, keep in mind that we are using a subset of the data with \\(10\\,km\\) rides, when no bridges have been crossed. treatment contrasts sum contrasts contrast coding yellow = 0; red = 1 yellow = -0.5; red = 0.5 \\(a\\) (intercept) interpretation The fare ride in a yellow taxi The average of the fares for a ride in a yellow taxi and one in a red taxi.6 \\(b\\) (slope) interpretation The fare difference between a ride in a red taxi and a yellow taxi. The fare difference between a ride in a red taxi and a yellow taxi. 4.4 Centered predictors Now let’s imagine that I don’t know if the number of passengers affects the fare. So far I’ve been riding alone. Now let’s look at a few rides with several other people (\\(distance = 10~km\\), \\(N_{bridges} = 0\\), yellow cabs only). As previously, we will model the relationship with a linear equation: \\[ \\text{fare} = a + b * \\text{number of passengers} \\] However if we model it like this, our intercept is 24 as you see in the plot below, and not 29, as we would expect. We did travel 10 km, after all. - Why is the fare so low? The reason is that the intercept is the value of the fare when all predictors are 0 - yes, even the number of passengers. Barring any extremely unusual situations, this is not actually possible, and therefore an intercept of this kind is really just a number we need to plug into the equation. In other words, we don’t learn anything from it. In order to remedy the situation and obtain a more useful intercept, we can center the predictor - that is, subtract the average of the vector from the vector itself. In this case, since the average number of passengers is \\(2.5\\), we will use \\[\\text{fare} = a + b * (\\text{number of passengers}-2.5)\\] This will leave us with the following interpretations of the coefficients: \\(a\\): the fare paid for the average number of passengers, in this case for 2.5 passengers (on a 10 km ride, crossing 0 bridges, in a yellow cab) \\(b\\): the additional fare for every additional passenger (on a 10 km ride, crossing 0 bridges, in a yellow cab) As you see, centering the predictor in a single-variable model changes the meaning of the intercept. As you can verify in the above plot, centering makes the intercept correspond to the cab fare at the average number of passengers (instead of at zero passengers). This change in interpretation is because centering changes the interpretation of the zero point of the predictor. While zero corresponds to no passengers when the predictor for the number of passengers is uncentered, it corresponds to the average number of passengers when it is centerered. The data is “moved to the left”, so to say. Because the intercept corresponds to the value of the fare at zero, the intercept changes as a result of centering. In sum, centering predictors in single-variable models can help obtain interpretable coefficients. 4.5 Main effects and interactions Let’s take a look the effect of cab color and cab size. What I didn’t mention before is that cabs come in two different sizes: 5-seaters, and 9-seaters. I want to find out whether larger cabs cost more. We’ll be looking at a subset of data with \\(distance = 10~km\\), and \\(N_{bridges}=0\\), only day rides. We will set up numerical contrasts for the predictors for cab color (yellow and red), and cab size (5-seaters and 9-seaters), and model the relationship with the following linear equation. This means that we are trying to estimate the (main) effects of cab color and size, and maybe something else. As previously, I would like to model the relationship using two additive terms, one for color, one for size. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{fare} = a + b_1 * \\text{cCabColorRed} + b_2 * \\text{cCabSize9Seater} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Let’s see if that’s possible. Here is a plot of the data along with connecting lines (not a model, just lines). This is weird … the effect of size depends on cab color. (You can see that the lines aren’t parallel, which means that the distance between them changes as x changes.) Here is the raw data. So, can we model the relationship using equation (4.2)? ## cab_color_red cab_size_9seater fare_mnt ## 1126 0 1 44 ## 4113 0 0 29 ## 5832 1 0 39 ## 9756 1 1 59 Of course not, because we need to account for the fact that the effect of color depends on size. In other words, there is an interaction between color and size. As you see, no additive model will describe the relationship correctly. Luckily, it’s only one point that is usually off. So what we need, is to ‘bump up’ the value at \\(size=1, color=1\\). We can do this by creating a new predictor from the old ones, and giving it its own slope: ## cab_color_red cab_size_9seater cab_color_red__by__cab_size_9seater fare_mnt ## 1 0 1 0 44 ## 2 0 0 0 29 ## 3 1 0 0 39 ## 4 1 1 1 59 The new model, which includes two ‘main effects’ and an ‘interaction’ between them becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{fare} = a + b_1 * \\text{cCabColorRed} + \\\\ b_2 * \\text{cCabSize9Seater} + \\\\ b_3 * \\text{cCabColorRed} * \\text{cCabSize9Seater} \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] In this model, 5 is added to the prediction when both size, and color equal 1. Such interactions also work quite well for continuous predictors, but that’s for another time … 4.6 Centered predictors and their effect on main effect and interaction coefficients We will set up numerical contrasts for the predictors for cab color (yellow and red), and cab size (5-seaters and 9-seaters), and model the relationship with the following linear equation. This means that we are trying to estimate the main effects of cab color and size, as well as their interaction. \\[ \\text{fare} = a + b_1 * \\text{cCabColorRed} + b_2 * \\text{cCabSize9Seater} + b_3 * \\text{cCabColorRed} * \\text{cCabSize9Seater} \\] We can treat the predictors in one of two ways7: We can either encode them using treatment contrasts (\\(0/1\\)), or using sum contrasts (\\(-.5/+.5\\)). Let’s review in turn what happens when we use each of those contrast coding schemes. If we use treatment contrasts, the combinations of our predictors can be reduced to the four unique cases below. The first three columns indicate the encoding of the color contrast (yellow=0, red=1) and size contrast (5-seater=0, 9-seater=1), and the interaction predictor (the product of the previous two). The next column illustrates what happens when we plug these predictors into the equation above. In other words, it shows how we can construct the predicted fare from the coefficients of the linear model. Finally, the last column illustrates the simplified version of the predicted value of the fare, with all terms which equal zero removed. This table below illustrates that: The intercept \\(a\\) corresponds to the fare for yellow 5-seaters (it is the only non-zero term in row (1a)). The slope \\(b_1\\) corresponds to the effect of color for 5-seaters only (it is the difference between rows (1c) and (1a)). The slope \\(b_2\\) corresponds to the effect of size for yellow cabs only (it is the difference between rows (1b) and (1a)). The slope \\(b_3\\) corresponds to the additional effect of size for red cabs. Alternatively, it can be understood as the additional effect of color for 9-seaters. (In understaning the above reasoning it may help not to focus on how \\(a,b_1,b_2\\) and \\(b_3\\) are obtained, but rather focus on how \\(a,b_1,b_2\\) and \\(b_3\\) would behave in the above equations if they corresponded to the meaning I assigned them.) color size color \\(\\cdot\\) size (1a) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(fare = a + 0 \\cdot b_1 + 0 \\cdot b_2 + 0 \\cdot b_3\\) \\(= a\\) (1b) \\(0\\) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(fare = a + 0 \\cdot b_1 + 1 \\cdot b_2 + 0 \\cdot b_3\\) \\(= a + b_2\\) (1c) \\(1\\) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(fare = a + 1 \\cdot b_1 + 0 \\cdot b_2 + 0 \\cdot b_3\\) \\(= a + b_1\\) (1d) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(1\\) \\(fare = a + 1 \\cdot b_1 + 1 \\cdot b_2 + 1 \\cdot b_3\\) \\(= a + b_1 + b_2 + b_3\\) One of the problems with the above coefficient interpretations is that in most cases they are not quite what we are looking for. In most cases, we’ll be interested in the average effect of cab color, the average effect of cab size, and the interaction between the two, and not in the effect of color for small cabs, the effect size for yellow cabs, and the interaction between the two. While we can compute one set of coefficients from the other, the former are far more informative. Using sum contrasts will give us more informative coefficients. The table below also illustrates that: The intercept \\(a\\) corresponds to the average fare in the data set (the average of the rows (2a-d) is \\(a\\)). The slope \\(b_1\\) corresponds to the ** average** effect of size (the average of (2a,b) minus the average of (2c,d) is \\(b_1\\)). The slope \\(b_2\\) corresponds to the ** average** effect of color (the average of (2a,c) minus the average of (2b,d) is \\(b_2\\)). The slope \\(b_3\\) corresponds to the additional effect of size for red cabs. Alternatively, it can be understood as the additional effect of color for 9-seaters. color size color \\(\\cdot\\) size (2a) \\(-.5\\) \\(-.5\\) \\(+.25\\) \\(fare = a - .5 \\cdot b_1 - .5 \\cdot b_2 + .25 \\cdot b_3\\) (2b) \\(-.5\\) \\(+.5\\) \\(-.25\\) \\(fare = a - .5 \\cdot b_1 + .5 \\cdot b_2 - .25 \\cdot b_3\\) (2c) \\(+.5\\) \\(-.5\\) \\(-.25\\) \\(fare = a + .5 \\cdot b_1 - .5 \\cdot b_2 - .25 \\cdot b_3\\) (2d) \\(+.5\\) \\(+.5\\) \\(+.25\\) \\(fare = a + .5 \\cdot b_1 + .5 \\cdot b_2 + .25 \\cdot b_3\\) \\(fare = a - .5 \\cdot b_1 - .5 \\cdot b_2 + .25 \\cdot b_3\\) \\(fare = a + .5 \\cdot b_1 + .5 \\cdot b_2 + .25 \\cdot b_3\\) Please note that we don’t neeed to assume that the ‘true relationship’ between the two variables is actually linear. Most interesting relationships are not linear. However, we can still learn a lot about them from a linear model as you will see in the following, especially if we are willing to assume that they are approximately linear. ↩ While the number of bridges depends on distance, it is in principle possible to cross a bridge while keeping the travel distance below a kilometer, in which case it would count as zero.↩ Please note that it is the average of the two fares, and not the average fare. ↩ There are more ways to encode the predictors, but these are the most common ones.↩ "]]
