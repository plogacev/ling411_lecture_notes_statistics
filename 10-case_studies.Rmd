# Case Studies


## VOT Data

- Data on voicing in English and Korean.

### Loading the Data
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# read English data and keep only relevant columns
vot_engl <- readxl::read_excel("./data/VOT/english.xlsx", sheet = 1) %>%
              dplyr::select(subject, gender, Item, WorldBet, TargetConsonant, TargetVowel, msVOT) %>%
              subset(TargetConsonant %in% c("d","g","th","kh"))


# take a look
head(vot_engl)

# which consonants are we dealing with, anyway
unique(vot_engl$TargetConsonant)

# Worldbet documentation in the appendix:
# http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/csc401/readings/worldbet.pdf
```

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# read Korean data and keep only relevant columns
vot_kor <- readr::read_tsv("./data/VOT/songyuan.txt") %>%
              dplyr::select(subject, gender, Item, WorldBet, TargetConsonant, TargetVowel, msVOT)

# take a look
head(vot_kor)

# which consonants are we dealing with, anyway
unique(vot_kor$TargetConsonant)
```

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}

typeof(vot_engl$msVOT)

# let's see if all msVOT are convertible to doubles:
subset(vot_engl, is.na(as.double(msVOT)))

# convert msVOT to a double
vot_engl$msVOT %<>% as.double()
vot_kor$msVOT %<>% as.double()


vot_engl$language <- "English"
vot_kor$language <- "Korean"
vot <- dplyr::bind_rows(vot_engl, vot_kor)
```


### Explorotary Data Analysis and Descriptive Statistics

- Let's try to understand our data better.

#### Averages
- Let's look a the average VOTs.
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
vot_avg <- vot %>% group_by(language, TargetConsonant) %>% dplyr::summarise(avg_VOT = mean(msVOT, na.rm=T)) 
vot_avg %>% ggplot(aes(TargetConsonant, avg_VOT)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")+ facet_wrap(~language)
```

#### Histograms
- Because we have relatively few target sounds, and relatively many data points per sound, we can take a look at histograms by sound.  
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
ggplot(vot, aes(msVOT)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(language~TargetConsonant, scales = "free")
```

#### Boxplots
- Let's look at them side-by-side, using *'box-(and whiskers)-plots'*. Boxplots provide a *five-number summary* of a distribution: 
  * The median, the 1st quartile (25th percentile), and the 3rd quartile (75th percentile) make up the box part.
  * The upper whisker extends from the third quartile to the largest observed value no larger than $1.5\cdot IQR$ from it.
  * The upper whisker extends from the first quartile to the smallerst observed value no smaller than $1.5\cdot IQR$ from it.
  
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
ggplot(vot, aes(TargetConsonant, msVOT)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~language, scales = "free_x")
```

#### Summary
- Voiced stops clearly differ from voiceless stops in VOT. (*What a surprise! :)*)
- A lot of variation in the English dataset.
- Lower *average* VOTs in English. Picture is a bit more fuzzy for the median.


### How long is the difference between voiced and unvoiced stops in English and in Korean? 

- Now is the time to fit a linear model to estimate the differences between mean VOTs. 
- Let's first create the right contrasts.

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# let's set up the right contrasts
unique(vot$TargetConsonant)
df_contrasts <- data.frame(TargetConsonant = c("d", "g", "th", "kh", "t", "k"),
                           is_voiced       = c(1,    1,     0,    0,   0,   0),
                           is_velar        = c(0,    1,     0,    1,   0,   1) 
                           )

# Create centered contrasts from dummy contrasts. That way, we'll be free to use whichever ones we like further down.
df_contrasts$c_is_voiced <- df_contrasts$is_voiced - 0.5
df_contrasts$c_is_velar <- df_contrasts$is_velar - 0.5

# merge the contrasts into the current data frame
# see cheat sheet for left_join: https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf
vot %<>% dplyr::left_join(df_contrasts)

# code the language too
vot$is_english <- vot$language %>% dplyr::recode("English"=1, "Korean"=0)
vot$c_is_english <- vot$is_english
```

- Let's start step-by-step and look at a range of models. In your term paper you will only need to present the one which is the most relevant.

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}

library(brms)

vot_english <- vot %>% subset(language == "English")

# An intercept-only model. We use it to check that all packages are properly installed
m1 <- brm(msVOT ~ 1, 
          family = gaussian(),
          data = vot_english %>% subset(!is.na(msVOT)), 
          file = "./models/vot_m1", cores = 4)

summary(m1)
```

- Let's look at model `m1` in more detail. Here is what that `brm` call does:
  * It says, *let's assume that all our observations are from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$*, and that *$\mu$ = a* (the intercept).
  * *Assuming that this model is correct*, what can we say about the *posterior distribution of the parameters $a$ and $\sigma$ given the data?*
  * Well, it seems that we can say that with 95% probability $a$ is in the interval $[38; 44.5]$, and $\sigma$ $[51; 56]$. 

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# A model with voicing as a predictor. What do the coefs mean?
m2a <- brm(msVOT ~ 1 + is_voiced, 
          family = gaussian(),
          data = vot_english %>% subset(!is.na(msVOT)), 
          file = "./models/vot_m2a", cores = 4)
summary(m2a)
```

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# A model with voicing as a predictor. What do the coefs mean?
m2b <- brm(msVOT ~ 1 + c_is_voiced, 
          family = gaussian(),
          data = vot_english %>% subset(!is.na(msVOT)), 
          file = "./models/vot_m2b", cores = 4)
summary(m2b)
```

- As you see, the slopes for voicing are the same, but the intercepts change if we change the predictor from dummy coding to a centered predictor.


- Let's look a the language too:
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# A model with voicing and language as predictors. What do the coefs mean?
m3 <- brm(msVOT ~ 1 + c_is_english + c_is_voiced + c_is_english:c_is_voiced, 
          family = gaussian(),
          data = vot %>% subset(!is.na(msVOT)), 
          file = "./models/vot_m3", cores = 4)
summary(m3)
```

- The average effect of language on VOT (for both, voiced and voiceless consonants), is $[-22; -15]$. 
- The average effect of voicing on VOT (across languages), is $[-72; -60]$.
- The interaction between language and voicing for VOT (the difference in the effect of voicing between languages), is $[-22; -8]$.



- Here is what happens if we remove all those odd VOT values. (They are all smaller than 0.) But can we even interpret the result if we selectively exclude data?
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# A model with voicing and language as predictors. What do the coefs mean?
m3b <- brm(msVOT ~ 1 + c_is_english + c_is_voiced + c_is_english:c_is_voiced, 
          family = gaussian(),
          data = vot %>% subset(!is.na(msVOT)) %>% subset(msVOT >= 0),
          cores = 4)
summary(m3b) 
```

- Certainly, some values should be excluded. For example, $-150\,ms$ seems like an absurdly low VOT value. But all of them? How about $-30\,ms$. This is where *domain knowledge* is required (which I don't have).

## Priming Experiment

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
# Load the 'primingHeid' dataset
library(languageR)

priming_data <- languageR::primingHeid %>% dplyr::select(subject=Subject, word=Word, condition=Condition, RT=RT, response_correct=ResponseToPrime)
priming_data$RT %<>% exp()
priming_data$condition %<>% dplyr::recode("heid"="related", "baseheid"="unrelated")
head(priming_data)

```
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}

priming_data %>% ggplot(aes(condition, RT)) + geom_boxplot()
```
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}

priming_data %>% group_by(condition) %>% dplyr::summarise(accuracy = mean(response_correct == "correct"))
```
```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}

priming_correct <- priming_data %>% subset(response_correct == "correct")

priming_correct %>% ggplot(aes(condition, RT)) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
priming_correct %>% group_by(condition) %>% dplyr::summarise(mean_RT = mean(RT))
```

```{r echo=T, messages=FALSE}
library(brms)

priming_correct$c_is_related <- priming_correct$condition %>% dplyr::recode("unrelated"=-.5, "related"=.5)

priming_m1 <- brm(RT ~ c_is_related, data = priming_correct, file = "./models/priming_m1")
summary(priming_m1)
```



# Your term paper

- Approximately 3-6 pages
- Three sections: Method, Results, Conclusion
- Analysis code in a separate R file
- Method:
  * What was the question we wanted to answer? (Imagine that you don't know anything about previous priming studies.)
  * Stimuli: 
    * What kind of words did we select? 
    * How were they selected? 
    * How was one condition different from the other? 
    * What were the fillers like?
    * How many of which kind did participants see?
  * Procedure: 
    * What did a single trial look like? 
- Results:
  * Descriptive statistics
  * Inferential statics (brms model; contact me or Utku if you have trouble in setting up brms -- we can run the model for you if all else fails)
- Conclusion?
  * Do we have evidence for priming?
  * (Could we have done anything better?)
