# Nondeterministic Linear Models {#lmNondeterministic}

-- to-do --


<!-- - fitting by R^2 or RMSE -->
<!-- - tells us how big effects are in the sample, on average, under certain assumptions -->
<!-- - no information about population -->

<!-- - Missing predictors are also a good context for introducing Simpson's paradox? -->

<!-- Separate subsection: -->
<!-- - "Why the non-determinism anyway?" -->

<!-- - Shortly after presenting data with a certain spread, ask something like "So how *does* the price depend on distance?" -> The answer is that we can't tell, because of all that uncertainty. But we *can* tell how the average price depends on it. -> But this is importantly, a different statement. (Though the first statement will be used as a short form.) -->
